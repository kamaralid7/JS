# Call Apply and Bind

#Call()
Using Call method we can do function borrowing
We can borrow functions from other objests and use data of other objects

Each and every method in JS has special access to call method
it is useful to borrow functions from other method

#Apply()
difference between apply and call() method is the way we pass arguments
first argument is the reference to this variable
second argument is the list to the arguments we have to pass in function
instead of passing this parameters individually we pass the arguments in an arraylist
