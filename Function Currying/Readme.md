# WHAT IS CURRYING IN JAVASCRIPT?

Currying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable multiple times, and it helps you create a higher order function.

# Why is currying useful in javascript?

It reduces the chances of error in our function by dividing it into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility.

It is very useful in building modular and reusable code

It helps us to avoid passing the same variable multiple times
