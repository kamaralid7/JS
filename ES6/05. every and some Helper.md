In ES6, the `every` and `some` array methods are useful for testing elements in an array against a condition. Here’s how each of these methods works:

### 1. `every` Method:
The `every` method checks if **all** elements in an array pass a particular test (predicate function). It returns `true` if all elements satisfy the condition, otherwise `false`.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.every(function(currentValue, index, array), thisValue)
```

- `function(currentValue, index, array)`: A function to test each element of the array. It can take three arguments:
  - `currentValue`: The current element being processed in the array.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
  - `array` (optional): The array `every` was called upon.

- `thisValue` (optional): A value to be passed to the function to be used as its `this` value.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Array of numbers
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Check if all numbers are greater than 5
const allGreaterThanFive = numbers.every(number => number > 5);

console.log(allGreaterThanFive); // Output: true
```

In this example, `every` checks if every number in the `numbers` array is greater than 5. Since all numbers satisfy this condition, `allGreaterThanFive` is `true`.

### 2. `some` Method:
The `some` method checks if **at least one** element in an array passes a specific test (predicate function). It returns `true` if at least one element satisfies the condition, otherwise `false`.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.some(function(currentValue, index, array), thisValue)
```

- `function(currentValue, index, array)`: A function to test each element of the array. It can take three arguments:
  - `currentValue`: The current element being processed in the array.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
  - `array` (optional): The array `some` was called upon.

- `thisValue` (optional): A value to be passed to the function to be used as its `this` value.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Array of numbers
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Check if at least one number is greater than 25
const someGreaterThanTwentyFive = numbers.some(number => number > 25);

console.log(someGreaterThanTwentyFive); // Output: true
```

In this example, `some` checks if at least one number in the `numbers` array is greater than 25. Since there are numbers like 30, 40, and 50 that satisfy this condition, `someGreaterThanTwentyFive` is `true`.

### Key Points:
- Both `every` and `some` methods iterate through array elements and apply a predicate function to each element.
- `every` returns `true` if **all** elements pass the test, otherwise `false`.
- `some` returns `true` if **at least one** element passes the test, otherwise `false`.
- These methods are useful for checking conditions across array elements efficiently without manually iterating through the array.

Using `every` and `some` can make your code more expressive and concise when performing checks on arrays of data in JavaScript. Adjust the predicate functions to suit your specific requirements and data structures.

## Syntax

Certainly! Here's a more detailed look at the syntax and usage of `every` and `some` methods in JavaScript:

### 1. `every` Method Syntax:

The `every` method tests whether **all elements** in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.every(function(currentValue, index, array), thisValue)
```

- `function(currentValue, index, array)`: A function to test each element of the array.
  - `currentValue`: The current element being processed in the array.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
  - `array` (optional): The array `every` was called upon.
  
- `thisValue` (optional): A value to use as `this` when executing the callback function.

**Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Check if all numbers are greater than 25
const allGreaterThanTwentyFive = numbers.every(number => number > 25);

console.log(allGreaterThanTwentyFive); // Output: false (not all numbers are greater than 25)
```

### 2. `some` Method Syntax:

The `some` method tests whether **at least one element** in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.some(function(currentValue, index, array), thisValue)
```

- `function(currentValue, index, array)`: A function to test each element of the array.
  - `currentValue`: The current element being processed in the array.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
  - `array` (optional): The array `some` was called upon.
  
- `thisValue` (optional): A value to use as `this` when executing the callback function.

**Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

// Check if at least one number is greater than 25
const someGreaterThanTwentyFive = numbers.some(number => number > 25);

console.log(someGreaterThanTwentyFive); // Output: true (there are numbers greater than 25)
```

### Key Differences:
- **`every`**: Returns `true` if all elements satisfy the condition in the callback function.
- **`some`**: Returns `true` if at least one element satisfies the condition in the callback function.

### Usage Notes:
- Both methods execute the callback function once for each element present in the array until it finds one where the callback returns a falsy value (`every`) or a truthy value (`some`).
- They do not modify the original array and do not execute the callback function for empty arrays.

These methods are powerful for checking conditions across array elements concisely and effectively in JavaScript. Adjust the callback function logic to fit your specific requirements for element testing.


## Finding submitted users using every and some

To find submitted users using the `every` and `some` methods, you would typically use a predicate function that checks a specific condition on each user object. Let's assume we have an array of user objects, each containing a property `isSubmitted` indicating whether the user has submitted a form. Here’s how you can use `every` and `some` for this purpose:

### Example Data:
```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', isSubmitted: true },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', isSubmitted: false },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', isSubmitted: true },
  { id: 4, name: 'David', isSubmitted: true }
];
```

### Using `every`:
The `every` method checks if **all** elements in the array satisfy a condition:

```javascript
// Check if all users have submitted their forms
const allSubmitted = users.every(user => user.isSubmitted);

console.log(allSubmitted); // Output: false (not all users have submitted)
```

In this example, `every` checks if every `user.isSubmitted` is `true`. Since Bob has not submitted (`isSubmitted` is `false`), `allSubmitted` is `false`.

### Using `some`:
The `some` method checks if **at least one** element in the array satisfies a condition:

```javascript
// Check if at least one user has submitted their form
const someSubmitted = users.some(user => user.isSubmitted);

console.log(someSubmitted); // Output: true (at least one user has submitted)
```

Here, `some` checks if there is at least one `user.isSubmitted` that is `true`. Since Alice, Charlie, and David have submitted (`isSubmitted` is `true` for them), `someSubmitted` is `true`.

### Conclusion:
- **`every`**: Checks if all elements in the array satisfy a condition.
- **`some`**: Checks if at least one element in the array satisfies a condition.

These methods are handy for checking conditions across arrays of objects, such as checking status flags like `isSubmitted` in this example. Adjust the predicate function to fit your specific criteria for determining if users have submitted forms or met any other condition based on your data structure.

##  In Progress Network request 

When dealing with network requests or asynchronous operations, you can use `every` and `some` methods to check conditions on arrays of promises or results. Here’s how you can simulate an example of handling network requests using `Promise` objects and these array methods:

### Example Scenario:
Let's simulate an array of `Promise` objects representing network requests. Each promise resolves with a boolean value indicating whether the request was successful (`true`) or failed (`false`).

```javascript
// Simulated network request functions returning promises
function makeNetworkRequest(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating a network request with a timeout
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = Math.random() < 0.8; // Simulate 80% success rate
      resolve(success);
    }, 1000); // Simulate 1 second delay
  });
}

// Array of simulated network requests
const networkRequests = [
  makeNetworkRequest('https://example.com/api/data1'),
  makeNetworkRequest('https://example.com/api/data2'),
  makeNetworkRequest('https://example.com/api/data3')
];
```

### Using `every`:
The `every` method can be used to check if **all** network requests were successful (`true`):

```javascript
Promise.all(networkRequests)
  .then(results => {
    const allRequestsSuccessful = results.every(result => result === true);
    if (allRequestsSuccessful) {
      console.log('All network requests were successful!');
    } else {
      console.log('Some network requests failed or not all were successful.');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error occurred while fetching data:', error);
  });
```

### Using `some`:
The `some` method checks if **at least one** network request was successful (`true`):

```javascript
Promise.all(networkRequests)
  .then(results => {
    const someRequestsSuccessful = results.some(result => result === true);
    if (someRequestsSuccessful) {
      console.log('At least one network request was successful.');
    } else {
      console.log('All network requests failed or none were successful.');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error occurred while fetching data:', error);
  });
```

### Explanation:
- **`Promise.all`**: Waits for all promises in the `networkRequests` array to resolve or any to reject.
- **`every`**: Checks if all elements in `results` are `true` (indicating all requests were successful).
- **`some`**: Checks if at least one element in `results` is `true` (indicating at least one request was successful).

In both cases, adjust the `makeNetworkRequest` function and the logic inside `every` or `some` to fit the specific conditions you need for determining the success or failure of network requests. This approach allows you to handle multiple asynchronous operations and check their outcomes efficiently using array methods in JavaScript.
