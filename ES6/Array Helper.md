ES6 introduced several helpful array helper methods that make working with arrays more convenient and efficient. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. **`map()`**: Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
   ```

2. **`filter()`**: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
   ```

3. **`reduce()`**: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0); // 10
   ```

4. **`forEach()`**: Executes a provided function once for each array element.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num)); // logs each number in the array
   ```

5. **`find()`**: Returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const found = numbers.find(num => num > 2); // 3
   ```

6. **`some()`**: Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const hasEven = numbers.some(num => num % 2 === 0); // true
   ```

7. **`every()`**: Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const allPositive = numbers.every(num => num > 0); // true
   ```

8. **`includes()`**: Determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const includesTwo = numbers.includes(2); // true
   ```

These methods provide powerful ways to manipulate arrays in JavaScript, making code concise and readable.

## Writing better code using helper methods

Writing better code often involves using array helper methods effectively to make your code more concise, readable, and maintainable. Here are some tips on how to achieve that:

### 1. Use `map()` for Transformations
Instead of manually iterating over an array to transform its elements, use `map()` to create a new array with modified elements based on a transformation function.

```javascript
// Without map
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = [];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    doubled.push(numbers[i] * 2);
}

// With map
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
```

### 2. Use `filter()` for Filtering
When you need to filter elements based on a condition, use `filter()` instead of a loop with conditional statements.

```javascript
// Without filter
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let evens = [];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
        evens.push(numbers[i]);
    }
}

// With filter
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
```

### 3. Prefer `reduce()` for Accumulation
For operations that involve accumulating values from an array into a single value, `reduce()` is more appropriate than a loop with an accumulator variable.

```javascript
// Without reduce
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
}

// With reduce
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
```

### 4. Use `forEach()` for Iteration
When you need to perform an operation on each element of an array without modifying the array itself, use `forEach()`.

```javascript
// Without forEach
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(numbers[i]);
}

// With forEach
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num));
```

### 5. Combine Methods for Complex Operations
You can chain array helper methods to perform more complex operations in a readable manner.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Example: Sum of squares of even numbers
const sumOfSquaresOfEvens = numbers
    .filter(num => num % 2 === 0)
    .map(num => num ** 2)
    .reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
console.log(sumOfSquaresOfEvens); // Output: 20 (4 + 16)
```

### 6. Use Arrow Functions for Conciseness
Arrow functions can make your code more compact, especially when used with array helper methods.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// Example: Using arrow functions with map and filter
const squaredEvens = numbers
    .filter(num => num % 2 === 0)
    .map(num => num ** 2);
console.log(squaredEvens); // Output: [4, 16]
```

### 7. Avoid Mutating the Original Array
Array helper methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` do not mutate the original array, which helps prevent unintended side effects and makes your code more predictable.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// Incorrect: Modifying the original array
const doubled = numbers.map(num => {
    numbers.push(num * 2);
    return num * 2;
});

// Correct: Creating a new array with map()
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
```

By leveraging these array helper methods and adhering to best practices like using arrow functions and chaining methods, you can write cleaner, more efficient, and easier-to-understand code in JavaScript.
