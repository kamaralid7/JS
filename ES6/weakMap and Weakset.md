In ES6, `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are extensions of the standard `Map` and `Set` data structures with a unique characteristic related to memory management:

1. **WeakMap**:
   - **Key Constraints**: Only objects can be used as keys (primitive data types like numbers or strings are not allowed).
   - **Garbage Collection**: Does not prevent its keys from being garbage collected. In other words, if there are no other references to a key stored in a `WeakMap`, both the key and its associated value can be garbage collected.
   - **Usage**: Useful for scenarios where additional data needs to be associated with an object without potentially preventing that object from being garbage collected when it's no longer needed elsewhere in the program.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let weakMap = new WeakMap();
   let key = { id: 1 };
   weakMap.set(key, "value");
   key = null; // This allows key to be garbage collected
   ```

2. **WeakSet**:
   - **Value Constraints**: Similar to `WeakMap`, only objects can be added to a `WeakSet`.
   - **Garbage Collection**: Like `WeakMap`, does not prevent its elements from being garbage collected.
   - **Usage**: Primarily used to store a collection of objects where membership needs to be weakly held, i.e., not preventing the objects from being garbage collected when no longer referenced.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let weakSet = new WeakSet();
   let obj1 = { id: 1 };
   let obj2 = { id: 2 };
   weakSet.add(obj1);
   weakSet.add(obj2);
   obj1 = null; // obj1 can be garbage collected
   ```

**Key Points**:
- Use `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` when you need to associate data with objects without preventing the objects from being garbage collected when no longer in use.
- They are particularly useful for managing auxiliary data tied to objects that are themselves managed elsewhere in your application.

If you have more specific scenarios or questions about using `WeakMap` or `WeakSet`, feel free to ask!

## When to use it

`WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to associate additional data with objects without preventing those objects from being garbage collected when they are no longer needed elsewhere in your application. Here are some specific use cases for each:

### When to use `WeakMap`:

1. **Metadata Storage**: If you need to associate metadata or auxiliary data with objects dynamically without impacting the object's lifecycle, `WeakMap` allows you to do so without preventing the garbage collection of the object itself.

2. **Caching**: Use `WeakMap` to cache computed results or additional data associated with objects. When the object is no longer needed and is removed from memory by the garbage collector, the associated data in the `WeakMap` is automatically cleaned up.

3. **Private Data**: `WeakMap` can be used to store private data associated with objects that shouldn't be directly accessible from outside the scope where the `WeakMap` is defined.

### When to use `WeakSet`:

1. **Membership Tracking**: Use `WeakSet` to keep track of a set of objects where the membership needs to be weakly held. This means objects can be added to the set without preventing them from being garbage collected when no longer referenced elsewhere.

2. **Event Listeners**: If you need to attach event listeners to objects and want those listeners to be automatically cleaned up when the objects are no longer used, `WeakSet` can be used to store references to these objects.

3. **Avoid Memory Leaks**: `WeakSet` helps in scenarios where you want to avoid memory leaks caused by unintentionally holding references to objects longer than necessary, especially in scenarios involving caches or temporary collections.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Caching Results**: Suppose you have a function that computes expensive results based on input objects. You can use a `WeakMap` to store these computed results keyed by the input objects. If an input object is garbage collected, its associated cached result will automatically be cleaned up from the `WeakMap`.

- **Event Handling**: When attaching event listeners to DOM elements, storing these elements in a `WeakSet` ensures that the DOM elements can be garbage collected when they are removed from the DOM, preventing memory leaks due to lingering event listeners.

In summary, `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are specialized data structures that help manage associations and memberships without affecting the garbage collection lifecycle of objects. They are particularly useful in scenarios where you need dynamic associations or temporary tracking of objects without holding strong references that could prevent objects from being cleaned up when no longer needed.
