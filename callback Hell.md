Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, refers to the situation in JavaScript programming where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read, understand, and maintain. This typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations that depend on each other or need to be executed sequentially.

Here's an example to illustrate callback hell:

```javascript
asyncOperation1(function(result1) {
    asyncOperation2(result1, function(result2) {
        asyncOperation3(result2, function(result3) {
            asyncOperation4(result3, function(result4) {
                // Nested callback operations continue...
            });
        });
    });
});
```

In this example:

- `asyncOperation1` initiates an asynchronous operation and provides a callback function `function(result1)` to handle its result.
- `asyncOperation2` depends on the result of `asyncOperation1`, and so on.
- Each nested callback makes the code increasingly difficult to follow, especially as more operations are added.

### Issues with Callback Hell:

1. **Readability**: The code becomes hard to read and understand due to the deep nesting of callbacks.
   
2. **Maintainability**: It becomes challenging to modify or extend the code because of its complex structure.

3. **Error Handling**: Error handling can become cumbersome, often leading to less robust code.

4. **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing bugs in deeply nested callbacks can be time-consuming and error-prone.

### Mitigating Callback Hell:

1. **Use Named Functions**: Define named functions for callbacks instead of anonymous functions. This improves readability and separates concerns.

   ```javascript
   asyncOperation1(function onOperation1Completed(result1) {
       asyncOperation2(result1, onOperation2Completed);
   });

   function onOperation2Completed(result2) {
       asyncOperation3(result2, onOperation3Completed);
   }

   function onOperation3Completed(result3) {
       asyncOperation4(result3, function onOperation4Completed(result4) {
           // Continue with operations...
       });
   }
   ```

2. **Use Promises**: Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, avoiding deep nesting and improving code readability.

   ```javascript
   asyncOperation1()
       .then(result1 => asyncOperation2(result1))
       .then(result2 => asyncOperation3(result2))
       .then(result3 => asyncOperation4(result3))
       .then(result4 => {
           // Continue with operations...
       })
       .catch(error => {
           // Handle errors
       });
   ```

3. **Use Async/Await**: ES8 introduced async functions and await expressions, which provide an even more synchronous-like way of writing asynchronous code using Promises.

   ```javascript
   async function doOperations() {
       try {
           const result1 = await asyncOperation1();
           const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
           const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
           const result4 = await asyncOperation4(result3);
           // Continue with operations...
       } catch (error) {
           // Handle errors
       }
   }

   doOperations();
   ```

By using these techniques, developers can avoid callback hell and write more readable, maintainable, and efficient asynchronous JavaScript code. Promises and async/await have become standard practices for handling asynchronous operations in modern JavaScript development.
